This visualization was done utilizing D3.js to create an interactive bar chart displaying 5 top causes of death in the US
from 1900 - 2015. The chart can be viewed either as a grouped or a stacked bar chart, selectable with the radio buttons. In the 
grouped view, the different causes of death can be either selected or deselected by clicking on the legend boxes.
